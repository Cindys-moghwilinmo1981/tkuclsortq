OMG, just finished watching It Feeds with my nerves basically in tatters, lol. Seriously, that movie was a total rollercoaster. Like, why did I even think it was a good idea to watch it right before bedtime? Ugh, every creaky sound I hear now is gonna have ghosts written all over it, ha. You know what I mean, right?

But for real, the storyline got me hooked from the start. Itâ€™s like, there was that part where they totally had no idea what was coming, and everything just feels off, almost like when your Wi-Fi goes out and youâ€™re left hanging. ðŸ˜‚ I mean, not that Iâ€™m comparing supernatural horrors with a Wi-Fi outage but, ya know, both suck. Anyway, I was so into it, felt like I was right there with them, like dodging ghosts and entities or whatever. 

> Honestly, the cast was kinda awesome too, even if I didnâ€™t recognize every single person. Sometimes you just download the movie thinking itâ€™ll be meh, and then WOW, it actually surprises you. Also, sidenote: can we appreciate eerie soundtracks more? The music was like, peak unsettling vibes, made me wanna look behind my shoulder every few seconds. And OMG, that ending! What was THAT about with the whole mirror thing?! Made me wanna throw popcorn at the screen.

I gotta say, though, sometimes the acting was a bit over-the-top. Like, come on, do people actually scream like that IRL? It's a movie, so I get it, but still... could have toned it down a bit maybe? And dude, the CGI ghost gooâ€”was that supposed to make us horrified or just slightly grossed out? Hard to tell, lol. Someone needs to slack off with the effects budget next time. But yeah, would def tell you to watch the movie if you're in for some late-night creepy feels.

printf(What even is code, right?);

And now Iâ€™m like... am I gonna have nightmares, or is midnight snacking my destiny to chase away the heebie-jeebies? Anyway, Iâ€™m gonna need a chill comedy next to cleanse the horror vibes. Whatâ€™ve you been watching?
